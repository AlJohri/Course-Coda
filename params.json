{"name":"Northwestern CTECS v2","tagline":"A completely new way to browse CTECS","body":"### Northwestern CTECS v2\r\nNorthwestern CTECS v2 is a totally new way to browse CTECS. It can do everything Caesar can do plus so much more.\r\n\r\nCheck it out [here](http://www.nuctecs.com/)!\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nNorthwestern CTECS v2 is 100% open source. Please feel free to contribute freely. To do so, submit a pull request and I'll review it asap. If you're interested in becoming a maintainer, let me know.\r\n\r\n## Development Setup\r\nNo more crazy multi-step development setups! Getting the Northwestern CTECS v2 environment set up couldn't be easier. OS X and Linux currently supported although Windows should work with very little extra work.\r\n\r\n1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\r\n\r\n2. Download and install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)\r\n\r\n3. Clone the repo (https://github.com/gpeal/Northwestern-CTECs.git)\r\n\r\n4. cd to the repo and run setup.sh. The script should work on OS X and Linux hosts. If you are running Windows, feel free to translate it to a .bat script (and submit a pull request) or just run the commands manually.\r\n\r\nThis will create a headless virtual machine that contains the entire development environment.\r\n\r\n## Developing\r\nOnce you have completed the setup:\r\n\r\n1. cd to the repo\r\n\r\n2. Start a new git branch\r\n\r\n3. run ```vagrant ssh```. This will start a headless virtual machine, forward the ssh and server ports (22 and 3000), and ssh into the virtual machine.\r\n\r\n4. Develop normally. Run ```vagrant ssh``` from the repo in any other terminal you want to develop from.\r\n\r\n5.
